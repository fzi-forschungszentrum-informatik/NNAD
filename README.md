# NNAD - Neural Networks for Automated Driving

This repository contains code for neural networks in the context of automated
driving. It currently contains the following branches:

- `develop`: training code for our research vehicle
- `featurenms`: code for our paper "FeatureNMS: Non-Maximum Suppression by
   Learning Feature Embeddings" (https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.07662)
- `icpram2020`: code for our paper "Simultaneous Object Detection and Semantic
   Segmentation" (https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.02285)
